**why navigation component?**

when we work with our android apps, when we think about navigation , we simply thinks that navigation is going from one activity to another activity by a button click etc. 

But if want to do something complex like doing navigation with bottom navigation bar, in that we need to take care of lot of things like on click of that button the correct page should open and button should get highligted and need to take care care of back- stack in a uniform way, so that pages don't get piled up again and again. so that users dont get confused.
